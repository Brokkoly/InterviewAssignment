### Notes While working
- Ah dang I don't have docker set up on my home computer. I'm not going to go through that right now.
- Time to just look at some stuff about tailwind and then get started.

#### First-UI Fix
- Feeling the rust from not using HTML and typescript in a bit, but it's coming back to me.

#### Initial Server Optimization
- Realized I could probably get docker set up quickly, so let's see.
- Alright, getting an error message and I don't know enough docker stuff to figure that out in the time limit. I'll just pseudocode some of that for the time being.
- Took a look at drizzle's website and I don't have time to be figuring that out since I already have the database.
  - I'll put in what I think would be correct later in comments

- Like all good server optimizations it requires UI changes
